  An Ode to the Printed Dictionary 2023
</p>

<p class="centre">
    In days of old, when words held sway,<br> 
    Print dictionaries, our guiding ray,<br> 
    Now mourn we must, their fading light,<br> 
    As digital reigns, they take their flight.<br> 
  <br> 
    Bound in leather, pages crisp and white,<br> 
    Their presence graced the scholar's sight,<br> 
    Thumbed through with care, each word explored,<br> 
    In print dictionaries, knowledge poured.<br> 
  <br> 
    A refuge found in a quiet nook,<br> 
    To seek the meaning, to pore and look,<br> 
    With finger tracing, we found the way,<br> 
    To decipher words in the light of day.<br> 
  <br> 
    But now, alas, their fate is sealed,<br> 
    In the digital age, they must yield,<br> 
    To algorithms and screens aglow,<br> 
    Print dictionaries, we let you go.<br> 
  <br> 
    No longer will we feel your weight,<br> 
    Upon the desk, your fate's too late,<br> 
    As bytes and codes, they take your place,<br> 
    We bid farewell, a fond embrace.<br> 
  <br> 
    Yet, in our hearts, your legacy lives,<br> 
    The wisdom, knowledge, that you'd give,<br> 
    Though print may fade, your words endure,<br> 
    In our language's tapestry, ever pure.

  On Faux-Spontaneity 2023
</p>

<p class="centre">
  How To Watch Birds investigates the<br>
  faux-spontaneous form of the show<br>
  as a whole, which often presents<br>
  itself as very casual and off the cuff,<br>
  <br>
  with John umming and ahhing while<br>
  narrating, despite the fact that his<br>
  dialogue is all clearly scripted and <br>
  planned to fit the narrative of the episode.<br>
  <br>
  But How To Watch Birds takes on a more<br>
  complex fictional narrative (climaxing<br>
  with John’s car exploding), which reveals<br>
  to the viewer there was a large amount of<br>
  <br>
  coordination and planning done, and helps<br>
  recontextualise other episodes of the show<br>
  by making us reconsider how planned they were.<br>
  Earlier in the episode John keeps the camera<br>
  <br>
  running after an interview concludes, showing<br>
  himself giving an envelope of money to<br>
  the interviewee. The fact this is included<br>
  in the final edit shows that John Wilson<br>
  <br>
  wants us to question the construction<br>
  of the entire series, to consider what is<br>
  real and what is not and how that<br>
  affects our perception of a scene.<br>

  Mine, Oh Mine! 2023
</p>

<p class="centre">
  This made me think of both my work and<br>
  the way I discuss these topics, because<br>
  on the one hand I think the methods<br>
  of production (Risograph, HTML coding, etc.)<br>
  <br>
  are generally quite evident in the form of<br>
  the outcome, but the conceptual elements<br>
  (gleaning, appropriation, disposability, etc.)<br>
  are less clear without my external explanation.<br>
  <br>
  This is why I think the <i>Positions Through<br>
  Essaying</i> video essay is one of<br>
  the most important projects I’ve done<br>
  so far. Previously, I had thought of<br>
  <br>
  it as separate to my publications.<br>
  Now I understand that it is not only<br>
  an explanation of my work up to that<br>
  point but also a creative output in<br>
  <br>
  its own right. And in the future I’d like<br>
  to try and build on this further, to blur<br>
  this boundary between content and explanation,<br>
  emphasising the narrative of<br>
  production as a form of output.
