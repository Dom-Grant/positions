  <i>How To Watch Birds</i> articulates its themes of transparency and using other people as content, both directly and indirectly, using the narration as well as the form of the episode itself. When John takes a polygraph test he is asked “Have you ever lied to someone on your show?” he pauses before replying “No.” the test operator says this is a lie. At another point episode keeps the camera running after an interview concludes, showing John giving an envelope of money to the interviewee, making us question the construction of the entire series.

  The episode also investigates the faux-spontaneous form of the show as a whole, which often presents itself as very casual and off the cuff, with John umming and ahhing while narrating, despite the fact that his dialogue is all clearly scripted and planned to fit the narrative of the episode. But <i>How To Watch Birds</i> takes on a more complex fictional narrative (climaxing with John's car exploding), which reveals to the viewer there was a large amount of coordination and planning done, and helps recontextualise other episodes of the show by making us reconsider how planned they were.

  These elements made me think of both my work and the way I discuss these topics, because on the one hand I think the methods of production (Risograph, HTML coding, etc.) are generally quite evident in the form of the outcome, but the conceptual elements (gleaning, appropriation, disposability, etc.) are less clear without my external explanation. This is why I think the Positions Through Essaying video essay is one of the most important projects I've done so far. Previously, I had thought of it as separate to my publications, now I understand that it not only an explanation of my work up to that point but also a creative output in its own right. And in the future I'd like to try and build on this further, to blur this boundary between content and explanation, introducing the narrative of production as a form of output.
