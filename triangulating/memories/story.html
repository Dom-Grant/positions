  SORRY.<br>
  THIS SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. <img src="https://freight.cargo.site/t/original/i/7050de71feb68e9ca17f5871a87611d8fe336476500de0ec8928c86aa060cf9e/jackhammer.gif" class="img">

  But since you're here I might as well tell you that:<br><br>
  Throughout the show, John consistently uses the everyday topics he discusses as a lens to view not only wider society but also himself. This is partially achieved through a consistent tone while shifting between subjects, which helps centre John Wilson and his positions at the core of the episodes and of the show generally. While I think this is something I’ve been able engage with (particularly when it comes to keeping a consistent ‘Dom’ tone), I don’t think I was fully able to explore and expose my positions until quite recently. The work in <i>Positions Through Triangulating</i> has allowed me to explore what it means to integrate a position into my work more than any of my previous projects, and I’d like to further emphasise my positionality more throughout my upcoming&nbsp;projects.
