Although this is also an area with tension between my work and John Wilson's, where due to the larger production scale everyone that appears in <i>How Toâ€¦</i> signs a release form after the footage has been taken. Whereas I have never obtained consent or permission for my work, whether taking test prints from the Publications workshop, using (presumably) copyrighted images from the LAION archive, or using animated gifs from a retired professor's website. I think this makes my work more like gleaning (as opposed to Wilson's semi-consensual voyeurism), where consent is implied by the original creator's act of discarding, and their agency and awareness is completely removed; shifting the timeline from present to past, moving my work from documentary to archeology.
