  <div class='child'>I also find the idea of going down rabbit holes to be an important part of my practice and my process, but it’s sometimes something I struggle to think of as a serious investigative or narrative framework.</div>
  <div class='child'>It’s something that is embodied well by the episode and the show generally; by starting with seemingly innocuous topics like bird watching John is able to disarm the viewer, and without even really noticing you become engrossed in the deeper topic.</div>
  <div class='child'>This is something I recently tried to do with my work using the found dictionary, where the form of my Memories of a Printed Age website was strongly inspired by Dr. Winfried Kerkhoff’s, after I became fascinated by the sprawling maze of information he’d built up.</div>
  <div class='child'>   I also wanted the website to become a kind of rabbit hole itself, and the final outcome ended up being a solid proof-of-concept for this without taking the concept to its extreme.</div>
