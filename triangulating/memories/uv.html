  One final element of tension between my work and John Wilson’s has been the willingness to pull the curtain back and examine the way the work was made. I want to try integrating this into the work itself, so I might as well start now: I made up the story of finding my dictionary in a charity shop. I lied about it being a spontaneous discovery prompted by the phrase “find your dictionary”. I thought it’d make it a more compelling story than the truth that I had found it on a shelf in my parent’s house and became interested in the form, rigidity, and obsolescence of printed dictionaries. And I’m not really sure why I lied; now that I write it out it all seems a bit silly. I guess in a way the lie does make it a more interesting story.<br><br>
  At least to me.

  “The world needs its illusions and who are you to take that away from them. So the next time something seems too good to be true, just enjoy that you live in a world where something like that is possible.” (Wilson, 2023).
