<h1>Introducing <img src="http://positions.domgrant.com/content/diploma.gif"> </h1>
<hr>

<p>
  Throughout Unit 2, my work has evolved in many ways, in particular regarding the way I integrated my positionality into the work I’ve been doing. In these writings I hope you’ll be able to better understand some of the inspirations, contexts, and reasonings behind my Unit 2 work.
</p>
<hr>

<p>
  The work has bounced around 4 main topics:<br>
	  &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Gleaning of imagery and information<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (specifically starting within CSM, and then moving to digital gleaning and things found within a second-hand shop)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Publications & publishing<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (first with handmade books, then publishing websites and using already published materials)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Gibberish & how oversaturation of information can remove meaning<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (looking at different ways to define and use gibberish, and how exhausting online existence can be nowadays)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Ephemerality<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (especially in relation to print vs online content)<br>
With my position and interest in each one coming in and out of the foreground and changing through the making I was doing every week. Through Triangulating I also began to consider Narrative and the way the work is presented as a story to be a key topic of the outcomes I’ve made. 
</p>

<p>
  For this writing I chose the form of the website as an evolution of the publishing focus from the start of Unit 2, as well as a way to continue the exploration into online oversaturation from ‘RIP THE NET’. The outdated Prof. Dr. style (Lialina, 2010) is a gleaned style, chosen for its early-internet fleetingness.

<p>
  Each of the writings presented here have been slightly edited for spelling, citations, etc. but have been kept as original as possible, to accurately show the evolution of my thinking as it happened.
